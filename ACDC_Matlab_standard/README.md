# Running the Matlab-ACDC

The Matlab package can be used to easily calculate and plot steady-state formation rates, concentrations and growth pathways, and examine the rate constants for a given cluster system.

In a nutshell, the Matlab package works as follows:
* The codes are run in subfolder ACDC_main.
* The main programs are run_steadystate_ABB.m and rates_and_deltags_ABe.m.
* The input is set in input_example_run_steadystate_ABB.m and input_example_rates_and_deltags_ABe.m, and the explanations for the settings, given inside the files, should be self-explanatory.

See the ACDC manual for more information.
